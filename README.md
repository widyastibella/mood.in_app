Discover electronic is an android app built to introduce non-electronic music listeners to electronic music. [Click here to see a demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyXKZyK1fMQ).

## Download the app
The app is on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duppy.discoverelectronic) and can be installed on your android device now!


## Using the app
To begin, select what kind of music you typically listen to. You will then be taken to your starting album on the electronic music flowchart. 

Once you've listened to the album, select your next album based on the descriptors provided. Want it to be more futuristic? More spaced out? Choose your path and discover your new favourite subgenre. There are also streaming links and links to more info for each album, as well as a checklist to keep track of what you've listened to. 

This app is meant to provide a high level overview of electronic music as a whole. Further exploration and research will be needed in order to assure an in-depth knowledge on any subgenre.

## About

This app was made using Kotlin with the Jetpack Compose UI library in Android Studio. The original flowchart was created by Reddit user u/Beef_The_Thief, and was expanded by me.
